== Description ==

A great plugin from the developers of Designersblog.net that will send a popup to people who have the Adblock browser extension installed. The text inside the popup is fully customisable with the new settings page that will intergrate right into your WordPress admin panel. 

This plugin will make it possible to get those earnings that you had before the adblock browser extension started. And the best of all, the plugin is completely free to use!

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `adblock-blocker` directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Change the settings of the plugin via the settings page inside the admin panel of WordPress.
4. Make sure you've defined wp_head and wp_footer in your template.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is AdBlock? =
Adblock extensions are the most popular extensions for Chrome, Firefox and Opera: Users that install AdBlock extensions avoid seeing any type of advertisements. Most users are not aware of the consequences it has for the webmasters.

= When i test it with Adblock the plugin doesn't work? =
Always try to refresh the page or restart your browser after activating the Adblock extension. 

= The plugin really isn't working? =
First of all when you need to make sure the directory name is: `adblock-blocker` because we had some issues with that in the beta fase.
When you are sure you've tested the plugin multiple times and it does not work, please send us an email on: info@buitengewoonuniek.nl

= I'm getting an error if i try to save the settings? =
Make sure all of the original Wordpress files have the right permissions.

= Is there a way to change the colors and style of the popup? =
Simply: Yes, but not in the options panel of the plugin. It is possible when you can edit php, css and html. There will be a function implemented so you can fully customize the style of the popup. This isn't a priority function so it won't be available before version 2.0 
The current style is located in the `scripts/popupbase.php` file.

= If you have any questions left, feel free to open a support topic. You can also paste your suggestions for Adblock blocker there. =
